    <h1>JASON NUTT</h1>
					<p>I have become passionate about designing and creating beautiful web sites and apps with clean and efficient
					code. It is my goal to improve the lives of my fellows through building them what ever they need.</p>
					<p>Winter Springs, FL 32708</p>
					<p><a href="mailto:jnutt367@gmail.com">jnutt367@gmail.com</a></p>
					<p><a href="tel:4076877889">(407)687-7889</a></p>
					<p>I believe that everything happens for a reason. Therefore, I have used the time of uncertainty due to Covid-19, to re-invent
					and invigorate my choice of careers. My new found passion for building responsive and dynamic sites and apps for the
					benefit of humanity is my purpose. I have faith that, through hard work and dedication, I will become great at being either
					part of a creative team or a master of creating things for individuals myself. Either way, I've got my boots strapped tight (pun
					intended) for the journey at hand. God Bless and keep you all until that journey brings us together. Who knows the
					opportunities we will bring to each other's lives as we trudge the road to happy destiny...</p>
